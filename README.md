# Intern case for MediaMonks

> Description

In this case I made a rebuild of the old MediaMonks website on how to become a monk. http://devmonks.vellance.net/p/path/
I worked with Html Css & Javascript, no libraries as stated in the assignment. Unfortunately I started with the Desktop variant
and was not able to make it in time to make the page responsive. I should have started mobile first :(

> Features

In this version I added some features. I detected that on your flash website you could also navigate through the arrow keys.
I also implemented this feature in my version. It still is a bit buggy, did not make it to provide code to stops you from clicking
through at the end or the beginning. (you can litterly click yourself out of the page atm.)

Besides the key events the website also works without Javascript. The image container receives a overflow-x of scroll.

> Wishlist

* [ ] Build the page more progressive enhanced
* [ ] OOP
* [ ] Responsive & Touch
* [ ] When Javascript is disabled jump to specific image with snap-destination
* [ ] Slide navigation in HTML instead of Javascript to enable navigation without Javascript (deeplinks)

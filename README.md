# Intern case for MediaMonks

> Description

In this case I made a rebuild of the old MediaMonks website on how to become a monk.
I worked with Html Css & Javascript, no libraries as stated in the assignment. Unfortunately I started with the Desktop variant
and was not able to make it in time to make the page responsive.

> Wishlist

* [ ] Build the page more progressive enhanced
* [ ] OOP
* [ ] Responsive & Touch
* [ ] When Javascript is disabled jump to specific image with snap-destination
* [ ] Slide navigation in HTML instead of Javascript to enable navigation without Javascript (deeplinks)
